## Notes

- Tasks are comprehensive and include all testing and validation
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation and user feedback
- Property tests validate universal correctness properties from the design
- Integration tests ensure all components work together seamlessly
- The pipeline should be tested with actual pushes and pull requests to validate real-world behavior
