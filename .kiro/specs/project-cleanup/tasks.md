## Notes

- All tasks are required for comprehensive implementation with full test coverage
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation at key milestones
- Property tests validate universal correctness properties across many inputs
- Unit tests validate specific examples and edge cases
- The cleanup tool will be a standalone TypeScript script in `scripts/cleanup/`
- Archive will be created in `.kiro/archive/` to keep it outside the root directory
